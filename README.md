# Interactive video project

## Live [demo](https://mikaeljan.github.io/employee-directory/)

## To do:
1. Add a way to filter the directory by name or username. To do this, youâ€™ll need to request a random user nationality that will only return data in the English alphabet. Note: you don't have to rely on the API to return search results. You'll need to write functionality that filters results once they already on the page.

2. Add a way to move back and forth between employee detail windows when the modal window is open.
